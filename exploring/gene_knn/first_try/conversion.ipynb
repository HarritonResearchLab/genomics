    "* ```result = pyreadr.read_r(rda_file)``` seems to give a dictionary of three dataframes with ```names = ['e', 'tissue', 'tab']``` which can be accessed like ```tab_df = results['tab']```. \n",
    "* It seems that the tissue dataframe has the outputs and the e (perhaps for expression) has the inputs. \n",
    "* There is a column that gets lost in conversion at the moment that has values like ```91952_at```. I believe this is a column of gene names. \n",
    "* The tutorial got rid of samples from the placentia because there were so few. "
